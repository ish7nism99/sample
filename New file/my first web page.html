    <p>i really love mariano diaz. madrid has good strikers in likes of luka jovic & him.<br>
zizou should give these youngsters some more time!<br>
also i'm expecting martin odegard to join real's squad again<br>
he is excellent player according to me!<br>
also i'm waiting for dani ceballos to join madrid back! <br>
i feel james rodriguez should be soldd as he is not getting enough time, <br>
sad to see such quality player not getting play time! <br>

i agree with your nominations for europe! i was real interested 
in the winners of ligue!<br>
what do you think who has more chances in liga?  </p>
